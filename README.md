# Color Catcher
A simple Unity game where you collect shapes of the same color to gain points.

## Rules
You are a shape, and you can only move horizontally. You are assigned a random color every time you collect one.

If you collect something with a different color, your color changes to that one and you lose a life. If it is of the same color (or a powerup), you gain points.

### Powerups
Powerups are **always yellow** and have particles in them. They can give you powers.

*Heart Powerup:* Changes your shape and heals you.  
*Lightning Powerup:* Increases your speed.

## Modding
My plan is to make this game modifiable in some way, either by creating levels or by adding entire mechanics.  
Currently, there is no way to do this. This section will be modified in the future.
