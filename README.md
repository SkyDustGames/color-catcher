# Color Catcher
A simple Godot game where you collect shapes of
the same color or the same shape to gain points.

## Rules
You are a shape, and you can only move horizontally. You are assigned a random color every time you collect one.

You need to collect shapes that match your color or shape, that can be changed through the Skins menu.  
If you collect something that doesn't match, you lose a life. Otherwise, you gain points.

### Powerups
Powerups are non-regular shapes, and always yellow. They can give you powers.

*Heart:* Heals you.
*Lightning:* Increases your speed.

### Skins
Use different shapes for your player.  
Available skins are:
- Circle (default)
- Square (10 coins)
- Triangle (20 coins)
- Hexagon (30 coins)

You gain coins by playing the game. If you get a score of 15, you get 15 coins at the end of the round.
